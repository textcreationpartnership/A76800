            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>ſt that proverbe ſhould be turned upon me, Prov. 26.17. <hi>He that medleth with ſtrife belonging not to him, is like one that taketh a Dog by the eare:</hi> The Reader may underſtand, that I entred not upon this controverſie without a ſufficient call, the which was this: There being a Sermon preached at Cranbrooke in Kent, by Mr. <hi>Francis Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> againſt <hi>Paedobaptiſme,</hi> therein was by him aſſerted, that it was an Antichriſtian Innovation, a humane Tradition, and that it had neither precept, nor example, nor yet true deduction from the Word; or words to the like effect. Divers of the Miniſters thereabouts; (Some whereof were preſent, and heard him) being much offended hereat (my ſelfe meane time being ſilent on both ſides) agreed together, that we ſhould in our private ſtudies examine the queſtion, &amp; at our next meeting, which was within a fortnight, bring our collections according as we found it; according to which agreement, I ſtudying the queſtion at large, found that it was a humane Tradition, and that it contained more evill in it then ever I could have imagined; according to our agreement, I brought in my arguments againſt infants baptiſme, nothing being brought in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence thereof; the Miniſters being hindred through forgetfulneſſe, and interruption of buſineſſe as they ſaid. The Collections being then and there read, a Reverend brother ſtood up in the name of the reſt, who ſpake to this Effect. That they ſought for truth rather then for victory; and therfore he deſired that the arguments might be left with one of them, that ſo they might be examined; whereunto all the reſt of the Miniſtres, then and there preſent, did accord; the arguments having lyen five weeks, and ſeeing no anſwer of any kinde given to them, I ſent for them home, and with ſome additions tranſcribed them for the Preſſe.</p>

If in any thing elſe there bee a miſtake, let the reader conſider in what untrodden paths our way lies.</p>
            <p>I was not ſo incogitant as not to forethink, that the Croſſe of Chriſt was like to attend the confeſſion of this tenent, for I well foreſaw it, but the evidence of truth ſhining cleer unto me, the Lord taught me not to conſult with fleſh and blood: I know it will be no little guilt at the day of Chriſt for the gaining earthly goods, and eſcaping temporall hazards, to wincke at light for feare of convincement, nor will then a Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke frivolous diſtinction, nor a Logicall fallacye, ſtop the mouth of that Conſcience from barking, which now thereby is layen to ſleepe.</p>
            <p>There are divers things alleadged againſt this tenent, or tenents;</p>
            <p n="1">1 Antiquity; To which I anſwer, infants baptiſme is ancient, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing neere ſo ancient as the world is borne in hand, the name of it is not in the world in the Apoſtles time nor many yeers after.</p>
            <p>Was not Epiſcopacie, giving the Lords ſupper to infants, ancient; put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away wives was ancient, but from the beginning it was not ſo, thoſe things which have not been in force from the beginning, cannot be in force by ſucceſſion of time.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The fewneſſe of thoſe that defend this: I anſwer, its true: But,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Truth hath often been locked up in the breaſt of few, who in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of voyces could not make their party good. In the firſt <hi>Nicene</hi> Counſell, <hi>Athanaſius</hi> almoſt alone did oppoſe the Arguments of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Mort. de concil. author lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>pag.</hi> 361. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Arrian the ſon of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> did upbraid the orthodox, that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> with four or five more troubled the peace of all the world, to whom <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> Biſhop of Rome, ſaid; The word of faith is not diminiſhed by my aloneneſſe: <hi>Theodoret lib.</hi> 2. <hi>hiſt.

            <p>The teſtimony of a few that are not blinded with temporall ends, but ſwim painfully againſt the ſtream, is not to be ſlighted.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Might not the ſame things ſeven yeers agoe have been alleadged againſt the Prelacie, Common prayer Booke, few oppoſed theſe; Its an hard thing to get an open heart to receive truths, when Magiſtrates are oppoſite, and the receiving hereof, ſhall expoſe our ſelves and families to want and miſery.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The vniverſality of thoſe that defend infant baptiſme, both church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and learned men; Though many of them have defended it, as <hi>Luther, Calvin, &amp;c.</hi> Yet there have been many that have oppoſed it, who have not wanted learning to defend their cauſe. For churches I ſhall hereafter ſhew how they have erred. I will now give one inſtance, <hi>viz:</hi> Their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake in the matter of the church, for ſo many hundred yeers, taking mixt multitudes for the matter thereof, when the Scripture makes Saints in profeſſion the matter thereof. Baptiſme being appointed of Chriſt, for differencing the matter of the church from all other ſocieties, ſurely a right baptiſme failing, in reſpect of the ſubject, a right matter muſt needs fail; theſe two errors like <hi>Hypocrates Twins,</hi> were borne at the ſame time, and will dye together.</p>
            <p>Now that the Saints are the matter of the church, peruſe theſe places: 1 Cor. 1.2. <hi>To the church which is at Corinthus, Sanctified in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus and called to be Saints,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.33. <hi>God is not the God of confuſion but of order,</hi> as in all the churches of the Saints. We ſee, <hi>All the churches</hi> conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Saints, Gal. 1.22. <hi>I was unknowne to the churches of Iudea, which were in Chriſt,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2.14. <hi>You became followers of the churches of God, which in Iudea are in Christ Ieſus,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.1. <hi>Paul and Silvanus, unto the church of the Teſſalonians, which is in God the Father and in the Lord Ieſus Christ.</hi> We ſee what perſons were churches, even ſuch as were deemed to be in Chriſt and in God. 1 Cor. 10.17. <hi>We being many are one bread, and one body;</hi> Now how can carnall and civill men make one bread and one body with the Saints.</p>
            <p>Apoc. 1.20, 12. The Seven churches of Aſia are called ſeven golden candleſticks, which ſhowes what kinde of matter the churches ought to conſiſt of.</p>
            <p>In a word to this objction of Churches, I will onely oppoſe the calve
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:154941:5"/> worſhip in Iſrael, that continued 200. yeares backt with authority, and the many idolatries and corruptions, that were univerſally upon every v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſible church in Antichriſts Apoſtacy. And for learned men, I oppoſe the learned Fathers for the firſt 300. yeares, or near upon, not regarding the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>thority of following times herein.</p>
            <p>The fourth thing objected, is that there are ſo many godly men among <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, that have ſuffered ſo much in the dayes of the Prelacy, for ſtanding out againſt them; and theſe are contrary minded, both thoſe in the Synod, and others out of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The examples of the holieſt men, are not rules for worſhip or conſcience, further then they follow the Scriptures; <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, there is more heed to be given to the Scriptures, then to the voice of Angels.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Godly men through ſlaviſh fears of povertie, diſgrace, &amp;c. may be ſlow in receiving convinceable truths.</p>
            <p n="3">3 One thing that may hinder godly men from receiving truthes, may be the diminution of their own repute, when they have formerly taught many glorious truthes, and now they muſt come to be aſhamed of their ſetting their poſts againſt Gods poſts. <hi>Pezelius</hi> in his book of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (if my memory fail me not, I having not the book by) ſaith; That wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n none from Franckford Mart, brought <hi>Calvins</hi> Inſtitutions to <hi>Luther,</hi> and after asked him what he thought of it? He anſwered, <hi>Profecto non in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>epte hic Author dixit.</hi> Yet would he not recant what he had ſaid, leſt the truth of all his doctrine ſhould be cald in queſtion; but ſecretly as I have heard, communicated his miſtakes to <hi>Melancton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 Many godly men (eſpecially thoſe of the Synod) have had little time to ſtudy this controverſie, being overburthened in their daily conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and weekly preachings, and the controverſie was but newly begun to be inquired into, in the beginning of their ſitting.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Theſe godly men, nor any other godly men in the world, that I ever heard of, ſuffered any thing for the defence of this point. But many have ſuffered for proteſting againſt it, and thoſe of Gods dear children. And this I am perſwaded, were times now, or ſhould they be hereafter, againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants baptiſme, there is hardly that perſon to be found, that would loſe a Living, much leſſe his life, for the defence hereof. And yet I doubt not, but many perſons who hold the ſame, in defence of a plain and clear truth, would not ſpare to ſacrifice livings, credit, life, and all for Jeſus Chriſt. For when a perſon is put upon loſing ſome dear enjoyment, and ſuffering ſome great hardſhip, a man will not go a jot further then he hath cleere light, nay in point of danger the fleſh ſeekes to winde out it ſelfe all that it can; So that if there be not a plain command from God, a man will not ſuffer.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The deſires of all I know not, but my own deſires, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of divers of Gods Saints, I ſhall propoſe, in all humility to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of; which may be conſidered under theſe par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cauſe the matter of the Church hath been ſo erronious, that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the power of all Ordinances and Keyes in a time ot univerſall defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſhould reſolve it ſelfe radically into the Church? Yet there being not any Church right for matter, which is part of the Eſſence; this power could not reſolve it ſelfe radically into a Church: And therefore if it be any where on earth (as doubtleſſe it is) t muſt needs be in believers, who joyning themſelves together in Aſſemblies, may ſtirre up and take again that power which was committed to the Churches, and after cheated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>If Idolatry, will-worſhip, falſe matter, can un-church Churches, then doubtleſſe all the Churches ſo overſhadowed by an Antichriſtian veile, have ceaſed to be Churches, and if neither Idolaters, will-worſhip, nor falſe matter, ſingularly, nor collectively, doe unchurch Churches; then the Churches under the Papacie, may perhaps be found to continue true Churches to this day, who have had a ſucceſſive, though not of preached doctrines, yet of perſons, ſuch as they were; which ſucceſſion hath been like a ſhip which the longer it went to Sea, the fuller it was of leakes. Yet if any pleaſe they may querie further of the two laſt branches.</p>
            <p n="2">2 We deſire a ſetting up of conſtitutions according to the Scripture; or in plaine termes, to have a Church deſcribed by ſuch notes that cannot be applyed to any other ſociety in the world, the taking away of one of which, deſtroyes the eſſence of the Church. That ſo Gods people may know how to recollect themſelves by theſe ſignes, as Captains in war uſe by military ſignes; to recollect their routed and ſcattered forces. Only we muſt conſider by way of premiſe, that which <hi>Zwinglius</hi> long agoe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that there are but two ſorts of Churches mentioned in Scrip ure.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Catholick, comprehending all the elect or body of Chriſt, borne or unborne, which were purchaſed with Chriſts blood; Eph. 5.25. Many
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:154941:7"/> men dream of a Catholick viſible Church: Jewes and Gentiles are taken into one body, Epheſ. 2.14. But not in reſpect of miniſteriall diſpenſation, but of myſticall union. The Fathers were wont to call the Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, in oppoſition to Heretikes; and in oppoſition to the Churches formerly cloſed up in Judaea, but not dreaming of any ſuch united viſible body here upon earth, alſo in reſpect that all beleevers had one and the ſame faith. If all the Churches in a Nation make one body Nationall, and all bodies Nationall make one body Catholike, then muſt there be a ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoul to animate this body; but this cannot be Chriſt nor his ſpirit, therefore muſt it be Antichriſt; who hath overſhadowed the whole world, under the cloud of a viſible catholike Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Particular church or churches; which is no other then a company of Saints in profeſſion, explicitely or implicitely conſenting together, to worſhip God in the Word, Sacraments, and Prayer, and all other duties of Religion.</p>
            <p>Now whereas there is mention made of churches in ſome particular mens houſes, as in the houſes of <hi>Philemon, Aquila,</hi> and others; I ſuppoſe the churches in thoſe houſes were no diſtinct kinde of churches, from thoſe that were named in Townes and Cities; but they were ſo called, becauſe the brethren did meet to worſhip God in theſe principall mens houſes, and becauſe its like there were divers beleevers in thoſe houſes. When the Apoſtles came to this or that City, we muſt not think that mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes were converted at once, but now one and then one; ſo that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the conſtituted churches were ſo ſmall, that they could well meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one place, in one private houſe.</p>
            <p>Now whereas ſome others have laboured to find a Presbyteriall church, in no place in all the New Teſtament, are the Elders or Presbytery cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo called; though many have laboured with all their power, herein to finde it.</p>
            <p>Much leſſe is there any ſhadow of a parochiall church, but it hath been brought in by Antichriſt of late dayes: Inſtead of a Parhagiall church conſiſting of Saints, Antichriſt hath brought in a Parochiall church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of a multitude, meaning the cohabiting multitude.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being thus premiſed, we will ſet down theſe ſignes of a Church, as they do in order of nature preſent themſelves; Theſe are ſixe, the three former neceſſary to the being; the three latter, to the well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a church.</p>
            <p>The firſt is a right matter, <hi>viz.</hi> viſible Saints, as was proved before; 1 Cor. 14 33. Matter towards the production of being, is in order, though not in time before form; therefore it is eſſentially requiſitie to a well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted church, that there be a right matter: We will not here diſpute,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:154941:8"/> whether churches failing in the matter, ceaſe to be churches? But this is enough, that we know God requires ſuch a matter; henceforth ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter muſt the churches have to be right, as the Apoſtolicall churches had; but they had Saints for the matter of their churches, therefore ſo muſt we have. Beleeve it, we are beholding for the recovery of this truth, to our brethren (nick-named Independants;) which is as precious a truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout church order, as ever was recovered from the ſpoiles of Antichriſt; for if the matter of churches be wrong, let the wiſeſt and holieſt do what they can, they ſhall never bring things into a comfortable order.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The ſecond Eſſentiall requiſite to a conſti uted church is agreement, conſent, or covenant, call it what you pleaſe, the foundations of all ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are and have been eſtabliſhed herein, nor can this nor any other ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be accidentally ſhuffled together as Cards in a pack, or Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s in a Lot box, therefore ſanctified reaſon requires, that a particular or viſible church (for theſe are <hi>terminis convertabiles</hi>) be eſtabliſhed by ſome kinde of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant or agreement, which to me ſeemeth ſufficient, if it came under no other precept but the precept of order, yet have we examples, both of the 3000. added to the Church at Jeruſalem, Acts 2.41, 47. and the Apoſtle Acts 9 6. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſaying to joyne to the church; who could not be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, till <hi>Barnabas</hi> gave teſtimonie of him, for thoſe places which ſome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for this covenant, from Deut. 26.17, 18. and 29.10, 11, 12.

            <p>Yet when I ſpeake thus of this covenant, its far from me to thinke that it doth give being to the Church: Its one thing to give being to a thing, <hi>per ſe,</hi> or by it ſelfe, and its another thing to concurre to the being of a thing; meate and drinke doth not give being to the life of man, though without it he could not live, for if he had not reſt, and Phiſicke and ayre, and Stomack, and digeſtive power, he could not live, though he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo good meate and drinke: So this covenant, or agreement, doth not give being to the church, for a company of Arrians, Socinians, Papiſts, &amp;c. may have a viſible Sanctitie, and enter thus into covenant, yet will not we call them a church, but a Synagoue of Satan, becauſe they want a

A man that is an Hereticke after the firſt or ſecond admonition, reject. When <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> made Shipwrack of their faith, <hi>Paul</hi> deliverd them to Satan, 1 Tim 1.20. There was no Compulſion by any civill Magiſtrate. So the inceſtuous perſon, there was no further proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt him, then the delivering of him to Satan. 1 Cor. 5.

If he will not hear the church, Let him be an Heathen or a Publicane; There was no writ granted of Excommunication, <hi>capiendi,</hi> to carry him to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon without Bayle or Mainprize, that hee ſhould have no power to make a will, or to deprive him of ſuch buriall, as other men had.</p>
            <p n="14">14 Compulſion in religion doth inforce perſons, not only to do things with a doubting conſcience, and ſo is ſinfull, Rom. 14.23. but makes men ſin againſt their conſciences, which is abominable; or elſe to ſuffer a ruine of their ſtates and perſons, which is uncharitable. In compelling perſons againſt conſcience, you compell them againſt that which they deem to be the eternall truth of God.</p>
            <p>If you ſay the magiſtrate hath no intent to compell me to ſin, nor to extort a confeſſion contrary to my conſcience; I anſwer, But he hath this end, that if I profeſſe not, what he thinks truth, or lawes enacted require, he intends to puniſh me with impriſonment, baniſhment, &amp;c. which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable in him: And what if for fear of the Magiſtrates force, rather then the fear of hell, I profeſſe a falſe principle, though I ſhall

            <p n="15">15 It brings no ſmall hazard and trouble to the civill Magiſtrate; hazard in expoſing him to perſecute the truths of God, a burden that hath lyen hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy upon the conſciences of Magiſtrates for many yeers paſt, that when ſome few in a Convocation have concluded ſome points Superſticious, or Erronious, the Magiſtrates, Judges, Juſtices have been the —to put theſe cruelties in execution, and they with trembling conſciences have hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped forward the exilement and miſery of many a Saint of God. The Scripture requiring weak brethren ſo be ſo far borne with, as wee ſee, Rom. 14 3.4, 5.

Beſides it will be a great trouble to him, to ſtudy in ſuch intricate caſes, when it is fit for him to imploy his coercive or conſtraining power, and when it is not fit: and if the ſame point which he now perſecutes, ſhall after appear to him to be truth, what a ſting will this be to his conſcience, when as all this trouble and hazard ſhall be taken away, if perſons may be left to worſhip God together, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the light they have, they behaving themſelves ſoberly, and peaceably in the Commonwealth.</p>

            <p n="22">22 It will much harden Heathens and Mahometans, not to permit chriſtians among them, or at leaſt not to have any great freedome in their countries, becauſe where chriſtians get the upper hand, they compell all perſons to embrace their religion; yea this very principle doubtleſſe ſcares the Papiſts from letting the Proteſtants have ſuch freedome in their countries, becauſe if they ſhould prove the ſtronger party, they would compell them to a religion they ſo much abhor.

Or in caſe, becauſe his conſcience could not cloſe with ſo groſſe a practiſe; himſelf and his poſterity to be ruined, meerly becauſe he makes conſcience; which doubtleſſe is a work of the ſpirit, in whomſoever it is.

            <p n="27">27 The Scripture no where makes the Magiſtrate judge of our faith, therefore he hath no power to compell our conſcience: Whiles we taxe the Romiſh French Churches (if I may ſo call them) for making Generall Councels the judge of the faith; and the Spaniſh and Italian Romiſh Churches for making the Pope judge of the faith: Take we heed we daſh not upon as great a rock, in making the Magiſtrate judge thereof: Who hereby will have ground either to make all mens principles ſubmit to his, whether they be true or falſe; or elſe to expoſe the refuſers to what pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty and hardſhip as he ſhall think meet. And ſo there will be a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall uncertainty in the enjoyment of any comfort any man hath, for as ſoone as the Magiſtrate changes his principles we muſt change, or elſe live in continuall hazard of perſecution. The conſcience of man next under God and his word, is to judge what faith is true and what falſe. Rom. 14.5.22, 23:</p>

            <p n="2">2 Though ſuch Doctrines are erronious in your conſcience, yet are you not ſure that ſuch are erronious in themſelves, becauſe you are not ſure your dictates are infallible.</p>
            <p n="3">3 If you were infallibly ſure you had the truth, and the doctrines you ſuppoſe, erronious, yet all errours being not of the ſame ſize, ſuch perſons may be borne withall, whoſe errours trench not upon the foundation.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Either Heretickes are in the church, or in the world, if they be in the church, the church hath power to cenſure them before they bee too ranke, Tit. 3.10. if in the world, what have churchcs or Elders to do with them? 1 Cor. 5.12. what have I doe to judge them that are without? and for the civill Magiſtrate, firſt how can he be guilded with a ſpirit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibilitie, that ſuch a thing is an hereſie, and much more that he hath infallible grounds for the violence or compulſion he exerciſeth towards ſuch perſons that he may do it in faith; 2 the civil Magiſtrate is abſolutely forbid all ſuch violence and rooting up, Mat. 13.30. Let <hi>both grow toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, untill the harveſt;</hi> but in what field is it? verſ. 38. Truely in <hi>the field of the</hi> World, and that by this Command, of <hi>let both grow together,</hi> is meant. Heretickes, Schiſmatikes; appeares becauſe, if the Magiſtrate be buſie about plucking up theſe, he will be in danger of plucking up the good wheate, that is, many a childe of God, who is thus ſtigmatized, and who thinks in conſcience he is bound to doe that which he doth.</p>
            <p n="5">5 If Hereſie and Truth may have a like permiſſion, Truth will get the victory in the underſtandings of many, yea moſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But we ſee the contrary in popiſh countries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> But the cauſe is not becauſe truth and error are left to fight in mens underſtanding, but becauſe men by inquiſitions ſuppreſſe the truth from paſſage, in ſome places, where truth and errour have been alike permitted; truth hath eaten out errour, witneſſe Amſterdam, not long ſince moſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, now almoſt all Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> But would you have all ſorts of Sects, and Sciſmes tolerated in Chriſtian churches, as Iewes, Papiſts, or all ſorts of Proteſtants differing in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:154941:17"/> Judgement as Lutherans, Arminians, &amp;c. This would tend to confuſion both in Church and ſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For the Jewes they are tolerable, for elſe how ſhould they ever be taken into us Gentil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s; it is not priſons and fines will bring them in, but a victory of Evangelicall truths in their underſtanding; for all ſorts of proteſtants they may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>olerated, becauſe no ſide dare affirme, that there adverſaries tenents are deſtructive unto their ſoules that hold them.</p>
            <p>And for Papiſts, though they are leaſt to be borne of all others, becauſe of the uncertainty of their keeping faith with hereticks, as they call us, and becauſe they may be abſolved of ſecurements, that can ariſe from the juſt ſolemne oathes, and becauſe of their cruelty againſt the Proteſtants in divers countries where they get the upper hand, and becauſe they are profeſt Idolaters, yet may they be borne with (as I ſuppoſe, with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to better judgements) in Proteſtant governments in point of religion.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Becauſe we have no command to root out any for conſcience, and leſſe then a command will not ſerve, nor have wee any example in the New teſtament for the ſame.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Violent compulſions of them, will rather exaſperate them againſt the Proteſtant religion, then win them to a liking thereof.</p>
            <p n="3">3 In the violent compulſion of Papiſts, nothing but miſchief ariſeth either to the partie compelled, who againſt his conſcience complies to the proteſtant religion, for the ſaving his eſtate, and ſo it is made two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold more the childe of hell; or elſe if he do not complie, but ſuffers, his innocent children are puniſhed herein.</p>
            <p n="4">4 It would be a good patterne to Papiſts in popiſh countries, to bear with proteſtants, and to remove inquiſitions.</p>
            <p>But yet with theſe two cautions may they be borne.</p>
            <p n="1">1 If the number be ſo many that they are like to overtop the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, or to come neer them in number, then the Magiſtrare giving them leave to ſell their eſtates, may command ſome of them out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, becauſe the ſafety of the people, is the higheſt law, and this is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that principle; Every being preſerves it ſelfe.</p>
            <p n="2">2 For the remaining party, to take ſuch ſecurement of them in point of Armes, that they may be ſure never to make any head.</p>
            <p>In all this I meddle not with delinquent Papiſts, who anſwering reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, for their acts of hoſtility againſt the ſtate, the number of Papiſts will be much fewer, and may the more eaſily be borne if the ſtate ſee fit.</p>
            <p n="5">5 <hi>Object.</hi> Why may wee not cut off Heretickes by death, or Puniſh them by baniſhment, impriſont, being they go about to deſtroy other mens ſoules.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:154941:18"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 Becauſe you have no command for it, nor no example, and leſſe then a plaine comand will not ſerve herein; Why do you not cut off perſons infected with the Pox, Leproſie, Peſtilence, being they hazard other mens lives? And why do Princes let them live in their common-weale, being they are ſo deſtructive to mankind; the reaſon is at hand, becauſe they have no command to do it, and the perſons may recover in time to come; ſo it is here, the Magiſtrate hath no command to cut off the Heretike, and alſo he may recover in time to come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But the ſimilitude holds not, becauſe there is no voluntarineſſe in him that is infected with a bodily diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No more is there any voluntarineſſe in the Heretickes in the ſeducing of others, for he thinkes that to be truth whereto he perſwades the other.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Its nor poſſible for the Elect to be ſeduced ſo far as to be taken off from their foundation, Chriſt; Mat. 24. But its poſſible for Heretikes to to come off from the foundation of their Hereſie, therefore they are to be let alone.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Few, of the controverſies among us, if any will, amount to hereſie, if we count hereſie to be election of a faith by our ſelves, they can at moſt be called ſchiſme; and therefore the perſons that hold the tenents, cannot come under the forſaid penallties of Baniſhment, impiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4 It much concurs to murther, that there be a murtherous intention, but Heretikes have no murtherous but a ſaving intention in drawing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to their way. He that ſhould goe about to deſtroy other mens ſoules, with an intention to deſtroy them, might be cut off as a murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. But he that doth it accidentally againſt his will is to have a city of refuge from temporall death, as he under the Law had, that ſlew a man againſt his will, which Law was no other then the Law of Nations.</p>

            <p>But if there ſhould be any ſuch toleration, we ſhould have a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full confuſion; parents would go one way, children another; husbands one way, wives another; maſter one way, ſervant another; which would be great confuſion in Church and State.</p>

            <p n="2">2 I anſwer with the ſaying of one, viz. Whether is it not a greater
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:154941:18"/> confuſion both before God and men, for a hundred men and women of ten ſeverall religions or opinions, to aſſemble together every Sunday in a Pariſh, for fear of impriſonment or fines, or elſe that the ſame hundred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing permitted freely to meet in a peaceable manner at ten ſeverall places, according to their different opinions, worſhipping God according to their light.</p>
            <p n="3">3 This is no other confuſion then is in an Army, wherein many that were together in a tumultuous manner, repair to their ſeverall Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Colours; or Citie ſocieties,<note place="margin">See Mr. Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wins Ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon on Acts 5.38 39.</note> wherein ſundry perſons in one and the ſame Houſe, belong to ſeverall Companies, one to the Drapers, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Mercers.</p>

            <p n="1">1 Had they beene ſo before, they would have beene ſo ſtill, and are ſo ſtill. 2 If they embraced the truth before, it was by accident; as a ruſtie hand of a clock, may by accident tell what a clock it is, though it ſtand ſtill and move not. 3 It appeares by their change that many of thoſe things they had, they had them onely by an implicite faith, not from an examination of the ground.</p>
            <p n="2">2 If they were good before, when in an ungrounded uniformity, they complied to the common practiſe without principles, or upon unſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing principles; they are ſure better Proteſtants now when they dare not do things without grounds.</p>

Let the Magiſtrate judge, whether the doing things out of conſcience, or the compelling men to do things with a doubting conſcience, or againſt conſcience, or in caſe of refuſall, to fine, baniſhment, &amp;c. be the more likely cauſe to procure theſe prolongings of our miſeries.</p>

                  <hi>Argument</hi> 7. <hi>Acts</hi> 19.2, 3, 4, 5. Baptiſme of perſons that want faith in one of the perſons of the Trinity is inſufficient.</p>
               <p>Infants at baptiſme wants faith, not onely in one, but in every perſon of the Trinitie, therefore there baptiſme is inſufficient.</p>
               <p>For the aſſumption, we have proved before that infants want faith at their baptiſme.</p>
               <p>For the propoſiton it appeares, Acts 19.2, 3, 4 When certain that were not well inſtucted in chriſtianitie had Baptized ſome Diſciples, but had not baptiſed them into the name of the holy Ghoſt, and its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable by <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpeech, verſe 4. that they were not baptiſed, ſo much as into the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, but onely into the name of one God, hence their baptiſme being defective in beleeving in ſome of the perſons of the Trinity, they counted their baptiſme not to be ſufficient and ſo had a right baptiſme, in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, neither was this a needleſſe ſcruple of Conſcience in them, for <hi>Paul</hi> did approve it, verſ 6. By laying his hands on them; How much more then is baptiſme of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants inſufficient, that do not beleeve in any perſon of the Trinitie. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let any man ſay this was a relation of <hi>Paul,</hi> concerning <hi>Iohns</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the time of <hi>Iohns</hi> miniſtery, ſo that this word <hi>(They)</hi> muſt have reference unto thoſe hearers, and not a relation of <hi>Paul</hi> concerning an act done by <hi>Iohn,</hi> it plainly appeares, becauſe the Apoſtle goes on in a continued Hiſtorie, concerning the Twelve, to verſe 8. for they that <hi>Paul</hi> laid his hands on and received the holy Ghoſt, and ſpake with tongues, verſe 6. muſt needs be meant, verſe 4.5.</p>
               <p>And whereas thoſe that maintain that <hi>Paul</hi> verſ. 4.5.6. relates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Iohn</hi> and his hearers. Contend that impoſition of hands, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving in Chriſt are all one, the contrary appears, Act. 16.17, 10, 47.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 8. The ſame condition and qualifications are required in perſons baptiſeable in our daies, as were required in times of the Apoſtles.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>But to have put on Chriſt to be baptized into Chriſts death, to have the heart ſprinkled from an evill conſcience, to be buried and riſen again with Chriſt, to have the anſwer of a good conſcience, were th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Therefore ſuch conditions and qualifications are required in our dayes.</p>
               <p>The propoſition appears, becauſe the eſſentials of the church of Chriſt are the ſame in all ages; and its no where ſaid, theſe conditions ſhall be eſſentiall requiſites to the planting of churches, but after churches be plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; members ſhall come in, in the faith of their maſter or parent.</p>
               <p>For the Aſſumption it appears, Rom. 6.3, 4. <hi>Know you not that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of us as were baptiſed into Ieſus Chriſt</hi> (that is the name, doctrine, and prof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But this was meant onely of thoſe that were brought out of a ſtate of Gentiliſme, but this doth not hinder but the infants of ſuch were baptiſed, though they were not deemed to have grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Apoſtle cuts of all ſuch allegations by theſe words; <hi>Know ye not that ſo many of you as were baptiſed into Ieſus Chriſt</hi> (that is the name and profeſſion of Chriſt) <hi>were baptiſed into his death, and buried with him by baptiſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So Gal. 3.26, 27. The Apoſtle had ſaid verſ. 26. The Galatians were <hi>all the children of God by faith in Chriſt Ieſus:</hi> he proves it from their bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, verſ. 27. <hi>For as many as were baptiſed into Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> that is his name and doctrine, <hi>have put on Chriſt.</hi> That is, all thoſe that were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Galatia, into the name, doctrine and profeſſion of Chriſt; had put on Chriſt before baptiſme, ſo farre as man could judge; elſe any man might have excepted againſt the Apoſtles reaſon, and ſaid this proves not the point: for they are others, that is to ſay infants, that are baptiſed into Chriſt, and have not put on Chriſt.</p>
               <p>So Coloſſ. 2.11, 12. The Coloſſians were not baptiſed to beleeve in time to come, but becauſe it was ſuppoſed, <hi>They had the circumciſion made without hands, by the ſpirit Chriſt:</hi> verſ. 11. <hi>death buriall and reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with Chriſt:</hi> verſ. 12. <hi>Alſo faith of the operation of God.</hi> Now how could this be ſaid of infants? So Heb. 10.22. <hi>Let us draw near with a true heart, in full aſſurance of faith, having our hearts ſprinkled from an evill conſcience, and our bodies waſht with pure water.</hi> Divines interpret this waſhing of our bodies, of the waſhing in baptiſme. And <hi>Estius</hi> upon the place, ſaith its the common expoſition as well of the Greeks as of the Latins, to underſtand it of the Sacrament of Baptiſm, which muſt needs be meant, becauſe he names the body; for if he would not have named ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:154941:33"/> that he had not named before, he would not have called it body but ſoul, and have ſaid, having your ſoul waſhed with pure water; but he had ſpoke before of the ſoul in theſe words, having our hearts ſprinkled from an evill conſcience; therefore he muſt needs ſpeak of ſuch a waſhing as reſpects the body as it is a body, which can be no other then the water of baptiſme. Which things being ſo, we ſee what kinde of perſons are baptiſed; Thoſe that had their hearts ſprinkled from an evill conſcience, and had faith to draw nearer in aſſurance to God.

               </p>
               <p>So for faith we have it to be a preparation only by deduction, Matth. 26.28. The cup is ſaid to be the <hi>Blood of the new Teſtament ſhed for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m ſſion of ſinnes:</hi> but this being apprehended no otherwiſe then by faith, faith muſt be a precedent requiſite to right receiving: This is the ſumme of the four Evangeliſts concerning this matter; ſaving that <hi>Luke</hi> addes theſe words, Luk. 22.19. <hi>This is my body which is given for you:</hi> which requires faith to beleeve this promiſe. For the ſixth of <hi>Iohn,</hi> the beſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines upon undoubted grounds confeſſe Chriſt ſpeakes not a word of the Supper. Another deduction I onely remember is from 1 Cor. 10.16.

               <p>To conclude, ſeeing the Scripture doth require the ſame requiſites to precede Baptiſme that it doth to precedr the Supper, as plainly yea farre more plainly; requiſites for Baptiſme being ſet forth by plain commands, practiſes and examples, and requiſites for the Supper, drawn only by plain and cleer deduction; I conclude, that without the foregoing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites of faith and r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If it be ſaid they are kept off from the Supper becauſe they cannot examine themſelves, ſo are they to be kept off from baptiſme, becauſe they have not faith, repentance, nor the covenanting of a good conſcience, 1 Pet. 3.21.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Circumciſion was commanded as well to reprobates as to the elect, Gen. 17.10. Every man childe among you ſhall be circumciſed; among which were many reprobates. <hi>Eſau</hi> af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> after God had rejected him in reſpect of ſpirituall bleſſings, Gen. 17.20. yet verſ. 23. he Was circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſo were all that were born in his houſe, or bought with mony. So that circumciſion was to be adminiſtred to reprobates as well as god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but baptiſme is to be adminiſtred onely to thoſe that repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Baptiſme and circumciſion do much differ. Firſt, as circumciſion was to be done the 8. day, Baptiſme any day. 2 Circumciſion was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the males, this on males and females. Circumciſion done by the parents to the children; by the father as <hi>Abram,</hi> by the mother as <hi>Zip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porah.</hi> Circumciſion belonged onely to the nation of the Jewes, baptiſme to the believers in all nations. So in ſignification, circumciſion ſigned a right to Canaan, baptiſme ſignes a right to the death and ſatisfaction of Chriſt. So in duration, the one was to endure to the end of the Jewiſh nation, the other to the end of the world. And though circumciſion be cald an everlaſting covenant, yet the Schooles diſtinction is known, <hi>aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num ſuis</hi> and <hi>aeternum dei,</hi> Exod. 21.6. His maſter ſhall bore his eare, and he ſhall ſerve him for ever. Exod. 28. 43, It was a ſtatute for ever, that <hi>Aron</hi> ſhould have his linnen breeches on, when they came to miniſter in the holy place. See Exod. 30.21. Levit. 6.18.22.7.34.36 10.15. Num. 18.11. Exod. 40.15. Their anointing ſhall be for an everlaſting Prieſthood. So that ever and everlaſting in the Old Teſtament are taken for length of time, or the continuation of a thing.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Circumciſion was a profeſſion of the obſervation of the Law. Rom. 2.25. Circumciſion verily profiteth if thou keep the Law, but if thou be a breaker of the Law, thy circumciſion is made uncircumciſion. <hi>q. d.</hi> They being not able to keep the Law, they were no leſſe miſerable then the Gentiles. For the Apoſtles ſcope is to humble the Jewes, who doted
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:154941:42"/> upon outward priviledges. Gal. 5.3. Every man that is circumciſed is a debtor to do the whole Law. Now to be a bond to keep the whole Law and to be a ſeal of grace and remiſſion of ſins, are two contrary things. Gal. 6.13. Neither they themſelves who are circumciſed keep the Law. <hi>q. d.</hi> The uſe of circumciſion in the Jewiſh Church, to binde the keeping of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, Acts 15.5. The Jewiſh brethren commanded to circumciſe them, and to keep the Law of Moſes. So verſ. 24, There were ſome that troubled you, ſaying that you ought to be circumciſed and keep the Law: ſo that keeping the Law is ſtill joyned to circumciſion. So that if you ask what circumciſion was, it was the profeſſion of the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Law; but baptiſme ſignifies forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, death, buriall, and reſurrection with CHRIST, which is a thing of another kinde.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Circumciſion differs from baptiſme, 1 in the matter, cutting in the fleſh being the matter hereof, which left a ſenſible ſigne in the fleſh, which the infant when he was grown up could behold all the dayes of his life. But dipping in the water is the matter of baptiſme, which leaves no ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſigne in infants; and therefore in reſpect of them cannot be a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="2">2 In reſpect of form of words, becauſe in circumciſion there are no words recited as in baptiſme, the Miniſter ſaith, <hi>I baptiſe thee;</hi> therefore perſons baptiſed ought to be capable of reaſon, that they may underſtand thoſe words, and forme their thoughts unto the death and reſurrection of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="7">7 It followes not becauſe of the difference in reſpect of the viſible church in the time of the Law, and the vſible churches under the times of the Goſpell, which differ.</p>
               <p n="1">1 In mater, the matter of the viſible church of the Jewes, was the whole nation of the Jewes good and bad; the matter of the Chriſtian church, are thoſe that profeſſe faith and repentance.</p>
               <p n="2">2 In the form of inrightment, Circumciſion in the fleſh gave a perſon inrightment to the viſible church of the Jews, but now circumciſion of the heart (at leaſt in profeſſion) is required, to make a man a member of the viſible church.</p>
               <p n="3">3 In kinde of worſhip, the Jewiſh worſhip and Prieſthood, and day of worſhip, and maintainance of Officers, that is tithes are put to an end, therefore there is an end of the viſible Church then, and inſtead thereof in the viſible churches now there are Miniſters to preach and baptiſe, there is alſo a new worſhip, and a new day of worſhip, and a new way of maintainance of Officers. Now there being a change of the Ordinances and government of the viſible church, it is a folly to argue from circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion to baptiſme.</p>

               <p n="3">3 Baptiſme is no outward covenant, and therefore cannot ſucceed circumciſion in any ſuch Identity, but is a ſigne or ſeal of an inward co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>viz.</hi> death, buriall, and reſurrection with Chriſt. <hi>Paul</hi> for all he was borne in the jewiſh covenant, and circumciſed the eighth day, yet did not <hi>Ananias</hi> nor himſelfe thinke this enough, but he was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, Acts 22.16.</p>

For the Colloſſians objected this, if Circumciſion be aboliſhed then we Chriſtians have no outward ſigne at all to confirme unto us Chriſts ſatisfaction, where by the mindes of beleevers may be confirmed and parſwaded that they are partakers of the Spirituall benefits in Chriſt: Now if baptiſme ſucceed circumciſion as an initiating ſigne, then as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were the circumciſed, ſo infants ſhould be now baptized.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We deny the conſequence, for thoſe in Coloſſe that were baptized were not infants but grown perſons that were <hi>circcumciſed with the circumciſion wade without hands, and had faith tbrough the operation of God.</hi>

Becauſe had there been any ſuch ſcruple, the apoſtle would have given ſome inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation thereof, or preparation thereto in words preceding, but he ſpeakes not one word tending to any ſuch thing; 2. becauſe he was not come to a period in anſwer to the circumciſion teachers, and did not come to a period, till the end of this 12. verſe, therefore could not bee upon any other ſubject in this verſe then he was in the former, and ſo much the word <hi>Alſo</hi> proves, and the appoſition of <hi>buried, circumciſed, and riſen again,</hi> proves it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe the Colloſians had baptiſme already being buried and riſen again with Chriſt therein, therefore they could not reaſonably object that the circumciſion teachers would aboliſh baptiſme, nor could they ſay what ſhall we do for an initiating ſigne to confirme our faith, for they had baptiſme already.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But ſuppoſe it were granted that baptiſme did ſucced circumciſion as an initiating ſigne, yet where is there any ſuch thing in the text as this, <hi>viz.</hi> As Baptiſme ſhall ſucceed in the ſame latitude of infancie, of ſo much as Males, much leſſe of Females, which is the ſuppoſition endeavoured to be proved from the text, nay the contrary appears, that there were none but grown perſons becauſe, they are ſaid to have faith and buriall and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection with Chriſt, which could not in an ordinarie way be affimed of infants.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe all the objectors premiſes were true yet all that can properly be deduced from it, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That circumciſion was an initiating ſigne to the Iewiſh church, and Baptiſme is an initiating ſigne to the Chriſtian church, and hereof there would be no great contention.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The true connection of the words with the foregoing, is this; <hi>Paul</hi> having anſwered Philoſophy teachers verſe 9.10. The word, <hi>Alſo,</hi>

He comes further to confirme them in it, by the ſeal or inſtrumentall ſigne thereof, which theſe Colloſſians had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy received, that is to ſay, by the ſeal or ſigne of baptiſme buried with him in baptiſme, wherein ye are alſo riſen again, &amp;c.</p>

What this yoke was, we ſee, Gal 5.3. to be debttors to keep the whole Law, and for failing in one point to be under the curſe Gal. 3.10. Deut. 27.26. and the Apoſtle verſ. 11. oppoſes the grace of the Lord Jeſus to this yoke.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not a benefit but a miſery for children to be baptized, for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are apt to thinke themſelves Chriſtians when they are ſtrangers from Chriſt.</p>

               <p n="2">2 In partiall or diviſine collection, and that in a twofold reſpect.</p>
               <p n="1">1 For the kinde of infants or little children living ſo, our Saviours words would not be true. For many of them (yea even the infants of godly parents) grow up and prove wicked, and do not receive the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, therefore it cannot be ſo taken, and we cannot know which will prove good or bad, that we may baptiſe or not baptiſe them.</p>

But the day he was crucified on, was the day before the paſſeover, as appeares,

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, to <hi>Abraham</hi> onely, and if <hi>Abrahams</hi> beleeving children among the Gentiles ſhould be baptized as he was circumciſed, then muſt it not be till they have the righteoſneſſe of faith as <hi>Abraham</hi> here had, at leaſt they muſt have it in profeſſion.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, Circumciſion was to every Male though reprobate; but baptiſme onely to the beleever, Mat. 28.19. There being a change of the viſible Church and of the Ordinances, this cannot ſucceed in room therof, nor hath any dependance thereon.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, for baptiſme is not a ſigne or ſeal of any ſuch outward holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which may befall reprobates as well as Elect, but it is a ſigne of death, Buriall, and Reſurrection, which the beleever hath with Chriſt. 2. There is no command for baptizing ſuch, if the Gentiles were ſo holy, which yet is not proved.</p>

As they that were not in the Circumciſion of Circumciſion were excluded, becauſe they were not expreſt as the males, and females of Heathen; So is it in Chriſts Commiſſion about Baptiſme, they that are not expreſt in it, are excluded from it.</p>

               <p n="4">4 Becauſe in falſe worſhip we are not ſo much as to touch the unclean thing: 2 Cor. 6.17. <hi>Come out from among them, and touch not the unclean thing.</hi> Now this being an unclean thing in my conſcience, I cannot nor muſt not touch it any way, neither with my affection nor with my bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſence; but that as ſoon at any preacher begins to pray for any ſuch thing, I muſt inſtantly depart, though it be in his prayer after his Sermon.</p>

               <p n="6">6 Its unlawfull for any Chriſtian, either to allow himſelf in that which he condemnes, or to condemne himſelf in that which he allowes: Rom. 14 2. <hi>Happy is he that condemneth not himſelf in that things which he alloweth.</hi> But by my preſence at ſuch a worſhip, I condemn my ſelf in that which I allow; my bodily preſence allowes that which my conſcience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes, and my conſcience condemnes that which my bodily preſence allowes.</p>

Mean time, becauſe the greater part go the broad way, and the Church is to judge onely of viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things, give us leave to forbear till we ſee how thoſe that have right can make it appear.</p>
            <p>This is the ſumme of Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> his Arguments; onely he breakes out with many aſperſions to render us odious, <hi>p.</hi> 17. as that the Anabaptiſts of this preſent age (for ſo he is pleaſed to call us that do deſire to offer up to God pure worſhip, and do abominate all ſuch points) ſail between two rocks, either to affirm that infants dye in their pollution, and periſh in their birth-ſin, or elſe to deny this originall pollution, or any birth-ſin
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:154941:63"/> at all: The latter of the two they therefore generally chuſe, judging it more fair to deny infants ſin, then to affirm their condemnation. So chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to joyn hands with <hi>Pelagians</hi> to deny originall ſin, they ſtrait fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on univerſall grace, freedome of will in things ſpirituall, the free Election of God they overthrow, leaving it in our power to make choiſe of Chriſt, and not Chriſt to make choiſe of us.</p>
            <p>Theſe things its like were written to render us odious, though not without ſome evaſion. <hi>p.</hi> 18. But to forbid rendring evill for evill, but after the example of our Lord, who when he was reviled, reviled not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, when he was perſecuted, he threatned not, but committed his cauſe to him that judgeth righteouſly. 1 Pet. 2.23. We anſwer to theſe aſperſions, that we ſail not betwixt two rocks, either to deny originall ſin, or to affirm that infants dying therein periſh. For we confeſſe every man by nature to be defiled by originall ſin, yet do they not die or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in it, becauſe from the grace of Gods Election, and the preſentment of the ſatisfaction of Chriſt to the juſtice of God, they are ſaved from it, which though it be apprehended by faith in thoſe that are capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, yet in thoſe that are not capable of believing as infants are not, it may through Gods free grace be preſented to Gods iuſtice. If we enquire how your infants dying after baptiſme are ſaved? You muſt have recourſe to this way of ſalvation, no other being aſſigneable.</p>
            <p>As falſe are the deductions that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> affirmes <hi>p.</hi> 17. that denying ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſin, we ſtrait fall upon univerſall grace, freedome of will in things ſpirituall, overthrowing of Gods election, for we have conſtantly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the contrary to that we are charged with; onely in point of Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobaptiſme: We deſire not for fear of perſecution, to wink againſt the light the Lord hath let us ſee. Let him remember what he ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 30. If a Turk fall upon a Popiſh State under the notion of Chriſtian, he is a perſecutor: If a Popiſh State fall upon a Reformed nation, he is much more guilty. A foul ſin for a people of God in name and title, to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his people in truth. To which ile adde, its more horrid for thoſe that are Gods people in truth (as I hope Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> is one, though I never ſaw him) to perſecute others who are no leſſe Gods people then himſelfe is, and that for difference of iudgement. For one godly man may perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute another, as <hi>Aſa</hi> who impriſoned <hi>Hanani.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. A believer can in the behalf of his infant, make good ſuch a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the inward Covenant, that none can ſay thou haſt no part nor por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this things, and becauſe it cannot be denied, it is to be preſumed. <hi>Pag.</hi> 29.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſp.</hi> The proof lies on the believers part, that his infant hath right to the thing ſignified in baptiſme, and ſo to the ſigne, before any Church can
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:154941:64"/> adminiſter Baptiſme, the ſigne or ſeal thereof; becauſe the Church iudge not of ſecret things, it lies upon their part to prove that they have part or portion, not upon the Churches part to prove they have no part or por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, It did not lye upon the Apoſtles to prove that <hi>Magnus</hi> had no faith, but upon him to prove that he had, ſo the Eunuch. Acts 8.37. Acts 10.49.</p>
            <p>Theſe are all the Arguments that are worth examining, which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath, ſave thoſe common obiections I have elſewhere anſwered. Onely ſome equivocate ſpeeches, that delude the Reader; as <hi>p.</hi> 28. In nature, children are their parents; in Covenant Gods: Every Chriſtian parent hath a childe of God committed to his tuition and care, which is by the Book, unleſſe he mean a childe of Gods creating, or maintain falling from grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 6. Gen. 17. I will be the God of thee and of thy ſeed, therefore all believers are in Covenant with God, and ſo they are to be ſealed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To all former Anſwers, ſee Obiect. 2. and 3. Ile onely adde, that it this Covenant with <hi>Abram</hi> was the Covenant of grace, yet was it made with the children of promiſe onely, which are believers of Jew and Gentile, and not their ſeed; many whereof are wicked, and preffered onely to the carnall ſeed that were circumciſed, and not made nor cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted with them.</p>
